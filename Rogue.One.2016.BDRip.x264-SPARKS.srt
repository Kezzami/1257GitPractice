2
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,780
- Mama!
- We know.

3
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,100
Jyn, gather your things. It's time.

4
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,730
- Hello?
- Saw, it's Lyra.

5
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,460
It's happened. He's come for us.

6
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,220
You know what to do.

7
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,820
Jyn, come here.

8
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,770
Remember, whatever I do,

9
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,940
I do it to protect you.

10
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,780
Say you understand.

11
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,260
I understand.

12
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,350
I love you, Stardust.

13
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,980
I love you, too, Papa.

14
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,420
Galen.

15
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,410
Go.

16
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,660
Jyn.

17
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,070
You know where to go, don't you?

18
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,220
Trust the Force.

19
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,660
You're a hard man to find, Galen.

20
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,090
But farming...

21
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,940
Really? Man of your talents?

22
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,540
It's a peaceful life.

23
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,140
It's lonely, I imagine.

24
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,860
Since Lyra died, yes.

25
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,780
Oh.

26
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,010
Oh...

27
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,100
My condolences.

28
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,300
Search the house.

29
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,260
What is it you want?

30
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,420
The work has stalled.
I need you to come back.

31
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,940
I won't do it, Krennic.

32
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,580
We were on the verge of greatness.

33
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,340
We were this close

34
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,700
to providing peace
and security for the galaxy.

35
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,060
You're confusing peace with terror.

36
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,230
Well,

37
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,860
you have to start somewhere.

38
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,900
I'd be of no help, Krennic.

39
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,740
My mind just isn't what it was.

40
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,500
I have trouble remembering.

41
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,930
Even simple things.

42
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,770
Galen...

43
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,420
You're an inspired scientist,
but you're a terrible liar.

44
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,210
Now, I admire the effort.

45
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,780
I really do.

46
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,730
Oh, look, here's Lyra,
back from the dead.

47
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,730
It's a miracle.

48
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,990
Stop!

49
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,820
Oh, Lyra,

50
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,780
troublesome as ever.

51
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,740
You're not taking him.

52
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,980
No, of course I'm not. I'm taking you all.

53
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,340
You'll all come. You, your child.
You'll all live in comfort.

54
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,300
As hostages.

55
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,900
As heroes of the Empire.

56
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,980
Lyra. Put it down.

57
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,620
Think very carefully.

58
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,780
- You will never win.
- Do it.

59
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,820
Lyra!

60
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,670
Lyra!

61
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,210
They have a child!

62
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,180
Find it!

63
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,090
My child!

64
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,890
Come.

65
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,100
Come.

66
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,620
We have a long ride ahead of us.

67
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,030
Check in security,

68
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,370
cell block 4227.

69
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,540
4227.

70
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,860
TK-62, XX-25900.

71
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,220
I was about to leave.

72
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,740
I came as fast as I could.

73
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,820
I have to get back on board.
Walk with me.

74
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,990
Back to Jedha?

75
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,060
They'll leave without me.

76
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,100
Easy! You have news from Jedha.

77
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,660
Come on.

78
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,940
An Imperial pilot,
one of the cargo drivers

79
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,300
he defected yesterday.

80
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,100
He's telling people
they're making a weapon.

81
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,060
The kyber crystals,
that's what they're for.

82
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,270
What kind of weapon?

83
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,810
- Look, I have to go.
- What kind of weapon?

84
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,620
A planet killer! That's what he called it!

85
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,700
A planet killer?

86
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,740
Someone named Erso sent him.
Some old friend of Saw's.

87
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,740
Galen Erso? Was it?

88
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,300
I don't know!
They were looking for Saw when we left.

89
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,740
- Who else knows about this?
- I have no idea.

90
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,180
It's all falling apart.

91
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,620
Saw's right.

92
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,060
There's spies everywhere.

93
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,190
What's all this?

94
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,620
Come on, let's see some scandocs.

95
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,500
Yeah, of course. Just... My gloves.

96
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,740
No!

97
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,660
What have you done?

98
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,620
Troopers down. Section 9.

99
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,980
Are you crazy?

100
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,930
I'll never climb out of here. My arm!

101
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,360
Get out of the way.

102
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,390
Move! Move!

103
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,020
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

104
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,750
It will be all right.

105
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,700
Is that him?

106
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,380
He looks kind of different
to how I imagined.

107
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,500
Okay.
So you're Saw Gerrera?

108
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,670
Saw Gerrera?

109
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,510
No?

110
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,160
Okay, we're just wasting time
that we don't have.

111
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,160
I need to speak to Saw Gerrera.
I keep telling them.

112
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,780
Before it's too late.

113
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,640
We're out here in the middle of nowhere.

114
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,340
We need to get to Jedha City.

115
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,740
What part of "urgent message"
do you guys not understand?

116
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,220
We are all on the same side.

117
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,900
If you just see past
the uniform for a minute.

118
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,940
What now?

119
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,310
I don't know. Must be another pickup.

120
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,900
I thought we had everybody.

121
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,220
All clear, sir.

122
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,220
Hallik! Liana Hallik!

123
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,390
Her.

124
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,260
You wanna get out of here?

125
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,380
Hey! What about me?

126
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,020
Give me the keys! Give me the keys!

127
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,780
Congratulations. You are being rescued.

128
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,460
Please do not resist.

129
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,620
LU-28,
report to maintenance level 4.

130
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,660
You're currently
calling yourself Liana Hallik.

131
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,810
Is that correct?

132
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,660
Possession of unsanctioned weapons.

133
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,820
Forgery of Imperial documents.

134
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,550
Aggravated assault.
Escape from custody.

135
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,140
Resisting arrest.

136
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,390
Imagine if the Imperial authorities
had found out...

137
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,300
who you really were, Jyn Erso.

138
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,260
That is your given name, is it not?

139
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,540
Jyn Erso, daughter of Galen Erso?

140
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,780
A known Imperial collaborator
in weapons development.

141
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,980
What is this?

142
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,160
It's a chance
for you to make a fresh start.

143
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,940
We think you might be able to help us.

144
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,300
This is Captain Cassian Andor,
Rebel Intelligence.

145
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,540
When was the last time
you were in contact with your father?

146
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,850
15 years ago.

147
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,970
Any idea where he's been all that time?

148
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,330
I like to think he's dead.

149
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,900
Makes things easier.

150
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,220
Easier than what? That he's been a tool
of the Imperial war machine?

151
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,090
I've never had the luxury
of political opinions.

152
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,270
Really?

153
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,580
When was your last contact
with Saw Gerrera?

154
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,570
It's been a long time.

155
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,500
But he'll remember you, though.

156
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,590
Wouldn't he?

157
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,860
He might agree to meet you,
if you came as a friend.

158
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,160
We're up against the clock here, girl,
so if there's nothing to talk about,

159
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,870
we'll just put you back
where we found you.

160
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,950
I was a child.
Saw Gerrera saved my life. He raised me.

161
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,200
But I have no idea where he is.

162
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,350
I haven't seen him in years.

163
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,780
We know how to find him.

164
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,090
That's not our problem.

165
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,330
What we need is someone

166
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,390
who gets us through the door
without being killed.

167
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,100
You're all rebels, aren't you?

168
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,100
Yes,
but Saw Gerrera is an extremist.

169
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,790
He's been fighting on his own
since he broke with the Rebellion.

170
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,540
His militancy has caused the Alliance

171
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,740
a great many problems.

172
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,220
We have no choice now but to try

173
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,700
and mend that broken trust.

174
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,770
What does this have to do
with my father?

175
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,460
There's an Imperial defector
in Jedha. A pilot.

176
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,300
He's been held by Saw Gerrera.

177
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,380
He's claiming the Emperor
is creating a weapon

178
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,660
with the power to destroy entire planets.

179
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,130
The pilot says
he was sent by your father.

180
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,280
We need to stop this weapon

181
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,500
before it is finished.

182
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,140
Captain Andor's mission

183
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,640
is to authenticate the pilot's story.

184
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,270
And then, if possible, find your father.

185
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,220
It appears he is critical
to the development

186
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,580
of this super weapon.

187
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,700
Given the gravity of the situation

188
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,620
and your history with Saw,

189
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,830
we're hoping that he will
help us locate your father

190
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,580
and return him
to the Senate for testimony.

191
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,020
And if I do it?

192
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,350
We'll make sure you go free.

193
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,870
Captain Andor.

194
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,940
I'm K-2SO.

195
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,870
I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.

196
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,380
I remember you.

197
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,900
I see the Council is
sending you with us to Jedha.

198
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,740
Apparently so.

199
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,060
That is a bad idea. I think so,
and so does Cassian.

200
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,510
What do I know?

201
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,500
My specialty is just

202
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,520
strategic analysis.

203
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,010
Galen Erso is vital to
the Empire's weapons program.

204
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,470
Forget what you heard in there.

205
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,300
There will be no extraction.

206
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,610
You find him...

207
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,540
you kill him.

208
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,500
Then and there.

209
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,030
Shuttle number LMTR-20.

210
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,650
Prepare for takeoff while
we check your authorization.

211
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,270
You met K-2?

212
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,410
Charming.

213
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,740
He tends to say
whatever comes into his circuits.

214
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,060
It's a byproduct of the reprogram.

215
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,740
Why does she get a blaster and I don't?

216
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,780
- What?
- I know how to use it.

217
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,620
That's what I'm afraid of. Give it to me.

218
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,580
We're going to Jedha.

219
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,140
That's a war zone.

220
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,770
That's not the point. Where'd you get it?

221
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,430
I found it.

222
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,470
I find that answer
vague and unconvincing.

223
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,620
Trust goes both ways.

224
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,180
You're letting her keep it?

225
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,870
Would you like to know the probability

226
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,060
of her using it against you?

227
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,860
It's high.

228
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,460
Let's get going.

229
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,020
It's very high.

230
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,190
Lies!

231
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,620
Deceptions!

232
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,870
Let's see it.

233
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,140
"Bodhi Rook. Cargo pilot."

234
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,060
- Local boy, huh?
- Uh-huh.

235
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,460
Okay. I can hear you.

236
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,520
He didn't capture me. I came
here myself. I defected.

237
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,550
I defected.

238
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,930
Every day, more lies.

239
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,900
Lies? Would I risk everything for a lie?

240
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,270
No, we don't have time for this.

241
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,470
I have to speak to Saw Gerrera
before it's too late.

242
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,500
Okay.

243
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,580
Sorry, you're...

244
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,740
Um...

245
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,900
That's for you.

246
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,470
And I gave it to them.

247
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,260
They did not find it!

248
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,620
I gave it to them.

249
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,340
Uh, Galen Erso.

250
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,780
He told me to find you.

251
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,030
Bor Gullet.

252
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,300
Uh, Bor Gullet?

253
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,340
What? Wait!

254
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,500
Galen Erso sent me!

255
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,540
He told me to find you.

256
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,260
Most unfortunate about

257
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,700
the security breach on Jedha,
Director Krennic.

258
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,460
After so many setbacks
and delays, and now this.

259
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,180
We've heard word of rumors
circulating through the city.

260
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,010
Apparently, you've lost

261
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,340
a rather talkative cargo pilot.

262
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,340
If the Senate gets wind of our project,

263
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,660
countless systems
will flock to the Rebellion.

264
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,340
When the battle station is
finished, Governor Tarkin...

265
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,700
the Senate will be of little concern.

266
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,460
When has become now,
Director Krennic.

267
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,190
The Emperor will tolerate
no further delay.

268
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,300
You have made time
an ally of the Rebellion.

269
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,660
I suggest we solve
both problems simultaneously...

270
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,740
with an immediate test of the weapon.

271
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,820
Failure will find you explaining why

272
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,900
to a far less patient audience.

273
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,090
I will not fail.

274
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,580
What's the matter, Jyn?
You look frightened.

275
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,100
I'll always protect you.

276
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,900
Stardust.

277
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,630
Don't ever change.

278
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,660
Trust.

279
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,350
Galen.

280
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,190
We're coming into orbit.
You have controls.

281
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,070
That's Jedha.

282
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,290
Or what's left of it.

283
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,300
We find Saw, we find your father.

284
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,180
What's with the Destroyer?

285
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,020
It's because of
your old friend, Saw Gerrera.

286
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,690
He's been attacking
the cargo shipments.

287
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,860
What are they bringing in?

288
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,430
It's what are they taking out.

289
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,460
Kyber crystal. All they can get.

290
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,440
We wondered why
they were stripping the temple.

291
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,500
Now we know.

292
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,100
It's the fuel for the weapon.

293
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,900
The weapon your father's building.

294
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,140
Maybe we should leave
target practice behind.

295
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,060
Are you talking about me?

296
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,940
She's right. We need to blend in.

297
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,250
Stay with the ship.

298
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,420
I can blend in. I'm an Imperial droid.

299
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,740
The city is under Imperial occupation.

300
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,510
Half the people here
wanna reprogram you.

301
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,260
The other half wanna
put a hole in your head.

302
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,730
I'm surprised
you're so concerned with my safety.

303
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,910
I'm not.

304
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,650
I'm just worried they might
miss you and hit me.

305
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,340
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

306
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:14,500
Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts.

307
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,900
No lie is safe.

308
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,660
What have you really
brought me, cargo pilot?

309
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,980
Bor Gullet will know the truth.

310
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,180
The unfortunate side effect
is that one tends...

311
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,580
to lose one's mind.

312
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,300
No!

313
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,340
Hey.

314
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,340
You just watch yourself.

315
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,510
Wait. No, no.

316
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,630
Sorry, sir.

317
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,340
We don't want any trouble. Sorry.

318
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,460
Come on. Come on.

319
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,580
Citizens of Jedha.

320
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,540
You must come forward with information

321
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,740
of the location
of this missing cargo pilot.

322
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,880
A reward of 600 credits
for the information shall be awarded.

323
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,920
I had a contact.

324
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,940
One of Saw's Rebels.

325
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,140
But he's just gone missing.

326
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,620
H is sister will be looking for him.

327
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,260
The temple's been destroyed,
but she'll be there waiting.

328
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,460
We'll give her your name

329
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,740
and hope that gets us
a meeting with Saw.

330
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,970
Hope?

331
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,860
Yeah. Rebellions are built on hope.

332
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,740
Hands where I can see them.

333
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,950
Get over there.

334
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,460
Show me some identification.
Check inside.

335
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,020
Is this all because of your pilot?

336
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,500
May the Force
of others be with you.

337
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,900
Wait for me.

338
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,820
May the Force
of others be with you.

339
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,570
May the Force of others be with you.

340
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,780
Would you trade that necklace
for a glimpse into your future?

341
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,110
Yes.

342
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,100
I'm speaking to you.

343
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,940
I'm Chirrut îmwe.

344
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,940
How did you know
I was wearing a necklace?

345
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,140
For that answer, you must pay.

346
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,300
What do you know
about kyber crystals?

347
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,980
My father, he...

348
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,090
He said they powered
the Jedi's lightsabers.

349
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,820
Jyn.

350
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,210
Come on. Let's go.

351
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,500
The strongest stars
have hearts of kyber.

352
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,590
Let's go.

353
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,500
We're not here to make friends.

354
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,630
Who are they?

355
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,460
The Guardians of the Whills.

356
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,140
Protectors of the Kyber Temple.

357
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,180
But there's nothing left to protect.

358
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,860
So now they're just
causing trouble for everybody.

359
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,580
You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.

360
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,620
We have to hurry.
This town is ready to blow.

361
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,950
Citizens of the Empire...

362
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,500
Imperial forces tirelessly fight
Saw Gerrera's reign of terror...

363
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,300
over the people of this beloved city.

364
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,860
Truth and justice
are the tools of the Empire.

365
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,420
Tell me you have a backup plan.

366
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,150
Incoming!

367
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,700
Looks like we found Saw's rebels.

368
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,710
Up there!

369
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,710
Jyn, no!

370
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,630
Hit the terrorist.

371
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,470
Get out of there!

372
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,980
Kyber...

373
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,410
Come on!

374
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,470
This way!

375
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,170
Cassian!

376
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,740
Did you know that wasn't me?

377
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,180
Yeah. Of course.

378
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,260
I thought I told you to stay on the ship.

379
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,260
You did. But I thought it was boring,

380
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,350
and you were in trouble.

381
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,660
There were a lot of explosions...

382
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,910
- for two people blending in.
- Freeze!

383
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,390
You're right.

384
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,180
I should just wait on the ship.

385
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,860
Halt. Stop right there.

386
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,150
Where are you taking these prisoners?

387
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,850
- These are prisoners.
- Yes. Where are you taking them?

388
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,660
I am taking them
to imprison them in prison.

389
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,420
- He's taking us to...
- Quiet!

390
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,540
And there's a fresh one
if you mouth off again.

391
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,040
- We'll take them from here.
- That's okay.

392
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,360
If you could just point me
in the right direction,

393
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,430
I can take them, I'm sure.

394
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,480
- I've taken them this far.
- Hey, wait a second.

395
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,570
- Take them away.
- Wait.

396
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,140
You can't take them away.

397
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,740
You. Stay here.

398
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,270
We need to check your diagnostics.

399
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,750
Diagnostics?

400
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,660
I'm capable of running
my own diagnostics,

401
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,750
thank you very much.

402
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,540
Let them pass in peace.

403
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,060
Let them pass in peace.

404
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,740
The Force is with me.

405
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,260
And I am with the Force.

406
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,570
And I fear nothing.

407
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,300
For all is as the Force wills it.

408
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,380
Hey, stop right there.

409
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,580
He's blind.

410
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,140
Is he deaf?

411
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,500
I said stop right there!

412
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,340
Is your foot all right?

413
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,460
You almost shot me.

414
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,300
You're welcome.

415
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,060
Clear of hostiles.

416
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,060
- One hostile.
- He's with us.

417
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,190
They're all right.

418
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,490
Thanks.

419
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,410
Cassian, I'm sorry about the slap.

420
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,460
Go back to the ship. Wait for my call.

421
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,470
Is he a Jedi?

422
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,500
There are no Jedi here anymore.

423
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,180
Only dreamers like this fool.

424
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,180
The Force did protect me.

425
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,790
I protected you.

426
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,940
Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?

427
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,020
Can't you see?
We are no friends of the Empire.

428
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,420
Anyone who kills me or my friends

429
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,340
will answer to Saw Gerrera.

430
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,100
Because I'm the daughter of Galen Erso.

431
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,060
Are you kidding me? I'm blind.

432
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,400
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

433
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,540
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

434
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,350
You pray?

435
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,780
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

436
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,950
Really?

437
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,830
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

438
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,060
He's praying for the door to open.

439
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,140
It bothers him because
he knows it's possible.

440
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,540
Baze Malbus was once the most
devoted Guardian of us all.

441
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,500
I'm beginning to think the Force and I
have different priorities.

442
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,060
Relax, Captain.

443
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,830
We've been in worse cages
than this one.

444
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,740
This is the first for me.

445
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,860
There is more than
one sort of prison, Captain.

446
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,340
I sense that you carry yours
wherever you go.

447
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,230
Jyn.

448
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,380
Is it really you?

449
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,380
I can't believe it!

450
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,260
Must be quite a surprise.

451
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,540
Are we not still friends?

452
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,290
The last time I saw you,

453
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,720
you gave me a knife
and loaded blaster...

454
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,310
and told me to wait
in a bunker till daylight.

455
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,260
I knew you were safe.

456
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,260
You left me behind.

457
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,740
You were already
the best soldier in my cadre.

458
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,780
- I was 16!
- I was protecting you!

459
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,950
You dumped me!

460
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,140
You were the daughter of
an Imperial science officer.

461
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,380
People were starting to figure that out.

462
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,340
People who wanted to
use you as a hostage.

463
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,420
Not a day goes by...

464
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,180
that I don't think of you.

465
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,020
But today...

466
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,580
of all days...

467
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,950
It's a trap.

468
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,420
Isn't it?

469
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,070
What?

470
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,420
The pilot.

471
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,940
The message.

472
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,100
All of it.

473
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,780
Did they send you?

474
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,740
Did you come here...

475
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,300
to kill me?

476
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,820
There's not much of me left.

477
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,300
The Alliance wants my father.

478
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,290
They think he sent you
a message about a weapon.

479
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:38,090
I guess they think by sending me,
you might actually help them out.

480
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,980
So what is it that you want, Jyn?

481
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,140
They wanted an introduction,
they've got it.

482
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,570
I'm out now.

483
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,580
Rest of you can do what you want.

484
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,340
You care not about the cause?

485
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,180
The cause?

486
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,900
Seriously?

487
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,420
The Alliance...

488
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,100
the rebels, whatever it is

489
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,640
you're calling yourself these days...

490
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,860
all it's ever brought me is pain.

491
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,660
You can stand to see the Imperial flag

492
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,740
reign across the galaxy?

493
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,690
It's not a problem if you don't look up.

494
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,980
I have something to show you.

495
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,270
Come.

496
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,460
The Emperor is awaiting my report.

497
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,300
One would hope that he and Lord Vader

498
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,920
might've been here
for such an occasion.

499
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,280
And I thought it prudent to save you

500
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,630
from any potential embarrassment.

501
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,900
Your concern's hardly warranted.

502
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,300
If saying it would only make it so.

503
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,300
All Imperial forces
have been evacuated...

504
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,580
and I stand ready to destroy
the entire moon.

505
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,890
That won't be necessary.

506
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,020
We need a statement, not a manifesto.

507
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,790
The Holy City will be enough for today.

508
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,020
Target Jedha City.

509
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:14,100
Prepare single reactor ignition.

510
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,420
- Sir, we're in position...
- Fire!

511
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,100
Commence primary ignition.

512
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,180
Who's the one in the next cell?

513
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,980
What?

514
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,100
Where?

515
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,700
An Imperial pilot.

516
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,040
- Pilot?
- I'm gonna kill him!

517
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,160
- No, no. No, wait!
- Come here!

518
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,740
No!

519
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,620
Back off! Back off!

520
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,940
Okay, okay.

521
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,500
Are you the pilot?

522
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,980
Hey. Hey. Are you the pilot?
The shuttle pilot?

523
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,460
Pilot?

524
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,140
What's wrong with him?

525
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,300
Galen Erso.

526
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,500
You know that name?

527
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,940
I brought the message. I'm the pilot.

528
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,900
I'm the pilot.

529
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,300
I'm the pilot.

530
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,140
Okay. Good.

531
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,700
Now where is Galen Erso?

532
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,350
Stand by.

533
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,660
This is the message I was sent.

534
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,060
Saw, if you are watching this...

535
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:50,340
then perhaps there's a chance
to save the Alliance.

536
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,620
Perhaps there's a chance
to explain myself...

537
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,860
and, though I don't dare
hope for too much...

538
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,490
a chance for Jyn, if she's alive...

539
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,620
if you can possibly find her...

540
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,540
to let her know that my love
for her has never faded...

541
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,180
and how desperately I've missed her.

542
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,100
Jyn, my Stardust...

543
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,100
I can't imagine what you think of me.

544
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,010
When I was taken,
I faced some bitter truths.

545
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,980
I was told that soon enough

546
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,820
Krennic would have you as well.

547
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,090
As time went by...

548
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,220
I knew that you were either dead...

549
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,690
or so well hidden that
he would never find you.

550
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:34,220
I knew if I had refused to work,
if I took my own life...

551
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:36,680
it would only be a matter of time
before Krennic realized...

552
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,060
he no longer needed me
to complete the project.

553
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,660
So I did the one thing nobody expected.

554
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,820
I lied.

555
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,380
I learned to lie.

556
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,700
I played the part of a beaten man

557
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,620
resigned to the sanctuary of his work.

558
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,580
I made myself indispensable...

559
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:55,820
and all the while, I laid
the groundwork of my revenge.

560
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,380
We call it the Death Star.

561
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,940
There is no better name...

562
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:03,540
and the day is coming soon
when it will be unleashed.

563
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,460
I've placed a weakness
deep within the system...

564
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,180
a flaw so small and powerful,
they will never find it.

565
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,410
But, Jyn...

566
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,300
Jyn, if you're listening, my beloved...

567
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:17,180
so much of my life has been wasted.

568
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,220
I try to think of you only
in the moments when I'm strong...

569
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,060
because the pain of
not having you with me...

570
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:27,180
your mother, our family.

571
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,380
The pain of that loss
is so overwhelming...

572
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,580
I risk failing even now.

573
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,180
It's just so hard not to think of you.

574
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,940
Think of where you are...

575
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,900
my Stardust.

576
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,310
Saw...

577
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,620
the reactor module, that's the key.

578
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,620
That's the place I've laid my trap.

579
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,020
It's well hidden and unstable.

580
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:53,260
One blast to any part of it
will destroy the entire station.

581
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,300
You'll need the plans...

582
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,180
the structural plans for the Death Star,
to find the reactor.

583
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:01,910
I know there's a complete
engineering archive...

584
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,060
in the data vault
at the Citadel Tower on Scarif.

585
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,660
Any pressurized explosion
to the reactor module...

586
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:11,370
will set off a chain reaction
that will destroy the entire station.

587
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,620
Go, go!

588
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,940
K-2, K-2! Where are you?

589
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:46,510
There you are.

590
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,580
I'm standing by as you requested...

591
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,940
although there's a problem
on the horizon.

592
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,100
There's no horizon.

593
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,940
Locate our position.
Bring that ship in here, now!

594
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,330
Where are you going?

595
00:47:58,590 --> 00:47:59,980
I gotta find Jyn.

596
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:01,790
Get the pilot, we need him!

597
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,180
All right.

598
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,860
I'll get the pilot.

599
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,540
Pilot.

600
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:16,230
No, no, no!

601
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,210
Let's go.

602
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,390
Jyn!

603
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,190
Jyn!

604
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:28,590
Hey.

605
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,910
We gotta go.

606
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,030
I know where your father is.

607
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,100
Go with him, Jyn.

608
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:37,270
You must go!

609
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:39,390
Come with us.

610
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,180
I will run no longer.

611
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,540
- Come on.
- But you must save yourself.

612
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,220
- Come on.
- Go!

613
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,430
There's no time!

614
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,820
Save the Rebellion!

615
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,380
Save the dream.

616
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,620
Oh, it's beautiful.

617
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,300
Chirrut, let's go!

618
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:28,460
Come on!

619
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,380
Let's get out of here!

620
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,110
Get us out of here!

621
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,290
Punch it!

622
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,280
I'm not very optimistic about our odds.

623
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:54,310
Not now, K.

624
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,430
Come on!

625
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,170
Punch it.

626
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:48,520
I haven't completed my calculations.

627
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,620
I'll make them for you.

628
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,820
I believe I owe you
an apology, Director Krennic.

629
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:24,980
Your work exceeds all expectations.

630
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,940
And you'll tell the Emperor as much?

631
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,440
I will tell him that his patience
with your misadventures...

632
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:33,780
has been rewarded with a weapon

633
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,300
that will bring a swift end
to the Rebellion.

634
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,500
And that that was only an inkling

635
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,300
of its destructive potential.

636
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,990
I will tell him that I will be
taking control over the weapon...

637
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:46,620
I first spoke of years ago
effective immediately.

638
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,820
We stand here amidst my achievement.

639
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,500
Not yours!

640
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,390
I'm afraid the recent security breaches...

641
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,140
have laid bare your inadequacies

642
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:00,980
as a military director.

643
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,300
The breaches have been filled.

644
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,100
Jedha has been silenced.

645
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,940
You think this pilot acted alone?

646
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:11,580
He was dispatched from
the installation on Eadu...

647
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:14,860
Galen Erso's facility.

648
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,020
Oh, we'll see about this.

649
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,750
A coded message
from Captain Andor, sir.

650
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,580
"Weapon confirmed."

651
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,580
"Jedha destroyed."

652
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,420
"Mission target located
on Eadu, please advise."

653
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:35,590
Destroyed?

654
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,570
Proceed.

655
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:46,140
Tell him my orders still stand.

656
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,300
Tell him to proceed with haste...

657
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,900
and keep to the plan.

658
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,530
We have no idea
what he's building for the Empire.

659
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,060
We have to kill Galen Erso
while we have the chance.

660
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,460
Baze, tell me.

661
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:11,620
All of it?

662
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,100
The whole city?

663
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:17,900
Tell me.

664
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,180
All of it.

665
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,010
Understood.

666
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,860
Set course for Eadu.

667
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:39,380
Setting course for Eadu.

668
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,420
Is that where my father is?

669
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,580
I think so.

670
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,740
So you're Galen's daughter?

671
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,350
You know him?

672
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,060
I am Bodhi, the pilot.

673
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,370
You brought the message.

674
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,500
Yes.

675
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,860
Your father...

676
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,700
he said I could get right by myself.

677
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,900
He said I could make it right...

678
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,940
if I was brave enough...

679
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:03,540
to listen to what was in my heart.

680
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,380
Do something about it.

681
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,460
Guess it was too late.

682
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,380
It wasn't too late.

683
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,860
Seems pretty late to me.

684
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,460
No.

685
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,380
We can beat the people who did this.

686
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,380
My father's message, I've seen it.

687
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,620
They call it the Death Star.

688
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,260
But they have no idea...

689
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,100
there's a way to defeat it.

690
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,490
You're wrong about my father.

691
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:33,700
He did build it.

692
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,740
Because he knew
they'd do it without him.

693
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,860
My father made a choice.

694
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,380
He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion.

695
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,940
He's rigged a trap inside it.

696
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,420
That's why he sent you,
to bring that message.

697
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:45,630
Where is it?

698
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:47,660
Where's the message?

699
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,090
It was a hologram.

700
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,620
You have that message, right?

701
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,940
Everything happened so fast.

702
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:05,780
Did you see it?

703
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:09,950
You don't believe me?

704
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,290
I'm not the one you've got to convince.

705
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:15,610
I believe her.

706
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,660
That's good to know.

707
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,020
What kind of trap?

708
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:22,820
You said your father made a trap.

709
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:25,100
The reactor.
He's placed a weakness there.

710
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:26,360
He's been hiding it for years.

711
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:28,340
He said if you can blow the reactor,

712
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,300
the module,
the whole system goes down.

713
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:32,980
You need to send word to the Alliance.

714
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:33,900
I've done that.

715
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,150
They have to know
there's a way to destroy this thing.

716
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:37,980
They have to go to Scarif
to get the plans.

717
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,740
I can't risk sending that.

718
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,740
We're in the heart of Imperial territory.

719
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,700
Then we'll find him and bring him back.

720
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,060
And he can tell them himself.

721
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,180
Course set for Eadu, sir.

722
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,210
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

723
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:30,550
20 degrees to the right.

724
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,540
10 degrees up.

725
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:34,850
Lower, lower, lower. Lower!

726
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:36,750
Are you sure this is the way?

727
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,280
They have landing trackers here.

728
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,390
They have patrol squadrons.

729
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,230
You've got to stay
in the canyon. Keep it low.

730
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:46,910
Watch your right!

731
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,980
There's a 26% chance of failure.

732
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,150
How much farther?

733
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:56,240
I don't know, I'm not sure.
I never really come this way.

734
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,420
But we're close, we're close. I know that.

735
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:59,920
Now, there's a 35% chance of failure.

736
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,200
I don't wanna know.
Thank you!

737
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,230
I understand.

738
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,890
Now! Put it down, now!

739
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:06,180
The wind.

740
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,710
If you keep going,
you'll be right over the shuttle depot.

741
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:09,910
- Watch out!
- K!

742
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,330
Hold on tight!

743
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,860
We're coming down hard!

744
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,270
Try them again.

745
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:31,260
I am, sir. We...

746
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:33,010
The signal's gone dead.

747
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:36,860
Squadron up.

748
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,860
Target Eadu.

749
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,100
How about now? Check stabilizers.

750
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:56,020
Bodhi, where's the lab?

751
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,190
The research facility?

752
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,310
Yeah. Where is it?

753
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,060
It's just over that ridge.

754
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,460
That's a shuttle depot
straight ahead of us.

755
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,300
- You are sure of that?
- Yes.

756
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:05,690
We'll have to hope

757
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:07,550
there's still an Imperial ship
left to steal.

758
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,460
Here's what we're doing.

759
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:12,500
Hopefully the storm keeps up
and keeps us hidden down here.

760
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,540
Bodhi, you're coming with me.

761
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,310
We'll go up the ridge and check it out.

762
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:17,530
I'm coming with you.

763
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,340
No, your father's message.

764
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,660
We can't risk it. You're the messenger.

765
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,360
That's ridiculous,
we all got the message.

766
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,530
Everyone here knows it.

767
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:27,160
"One blast to the reactor module

768
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,940
"and the whole system goes down."

769
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,740
That's how you said it,
"The whole system goes down."

770
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,900
Get to work fixing our comms.

771
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,860
All I want to do right now
is get a handle on what we're up against.

772
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:40,860
So we're gonna go very small
and very careful up the rise...

773
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,070
and see what's what.

774
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,020
Let's get outta here.

775
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,820
Does he look like a killer?

776
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,940
No. He has the face of a friend.

777
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,860
Who are you talking about?

778
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,460
Captain Andor.

779
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:07,660
Why'd you ask that?

780
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,670
What do you mean,
"Does he look like a killer?"

781
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,180
The Force moves darkly

782
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:13,180
near a creature that's about to kill.

783
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,380
His weapon was
in the sniper configuration.

784
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:26,020
No, no, no. We've got to go up.

785
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:27,700
You can't see much from down there.

786
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:02,670
This way.

787
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,460
I'll be right behind you.

788
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,460
Come on.

789
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:25,860
Where are you going?

790
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,940
I'm gonna follow Jyn.

791
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,020
Her path is clear.

792
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,780
Alone?

793
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:33,260
Good luck!

794
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:36,460
I don't need luck. I have you!

795
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,060
What are they doing?

796
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,140
If Cassian comes back,
we're leaving without them.

797
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:10,660
You see Erso out there?

798
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,580
We've come too far.

799
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,580
Patience, my friend.

800
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:35,940
That's him.

801
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:38,780
That's him. Galen, in the dark suit.

802
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:57,260
Get back down there
and find us a ride outta here.

803
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,540
- Well, what are you doing?
- You heard me.

804
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,400
You said we came up here
just to have a look.

805
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,580
I'm here, I'm looking. Go.

806
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:05,930
Hurry!

807
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,220
Excellent news, Galen.

808
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,950
The battle station is complete.

809
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:22,900
You must be very proud.

810
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,420
Proud as I can be, Krennic.

811
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,660
Gather your engineers.
I have an announcement.

812
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,060
Is that all of them?

813
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:47,580
Yes.

814
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,130
Gentlemen, one of you...

815
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,500
betrayed the Empire.

816
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,220
One of you has conspired with a pilot...

817
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:05,340
to send messages to the Rebellion.

818
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,420
And I urge that traitor...

819
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:09,900
step forward.

820
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:24,780
Very well...

821
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:26,900
I'll consider it a group effort then.

822
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:28,300
Ready!

823
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,900
- No! No!
- Aim!

824
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:32,860
And fire!

825
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:34,500
Stop! Stop! Stop!

826
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:35,670
Krennic, stop!

827
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:39,020
It was me!

828
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:50,820
They have nothing to do with it.

829
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:52,340
Spare them.

830
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:18,590
Fire!

831
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:33,170
How do I know the weapon is complete?

832
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:36,860
Let me share with you some details.

833
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:52,270
Cassian.

834
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:54,260
Cassian, can you hear me?

835
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,920
I'm here.
You've got it working?

836
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,710
Affirmative, yes.
Although we have a problem.

837
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,380
There's an Alliance squadron
approaching. Clear the area.

838
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:02,740
No, no, no, no! Tell them to hold off!

839
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:04,380
Jyn's on that platform.

840
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:08,350
Jedha...

841
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:12,580
Saw Gerrera. His band of fanatics...

842
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,300
their Holy City...

843
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:18,140
the last reminder of the Jedi, gone.

844
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:20,820
You'll never win.

845
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:24,180
Now where have I heard that before?

846
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,060
Relay from Captain Andor.

847
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:28,460
General.

848
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:31,130
Captain Andor requesting
a delay on squadron support.

849
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:33,860
Alliance forces on site. Please confirm.

850
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,740
Get the squadron leader on.
Get him on now!

851
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:37,170
They're already engaged, sir.

852
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:03,580
Jyn. No.

853
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,860
Return fire! To your stations!

854
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,100
Get our fighters in the air now!

855
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:17,380
Father!

856
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:38,580
Roger that. 3 through 7.

857
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:55,820
Fall back! Fall back!

858
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:58,980
Director, we need to evacuate.

859
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:11,500
Papa. Papa, it's me.

860
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:16,290
It's Jyn.

861
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:18,100
Jyn?

862
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:21,570
Stardust.

863
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:23,610
Papa.

864
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:26,580
I've seen your message.

865
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,700
The hologram, I've seen it.

866
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,780
It must be destroyed.

867
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,980
I know. I know.

868
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:35,830
We will.

869
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,250
Jyn.

870
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:41,990
Look at you.

871
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,700
I have so much to tell you.

872
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:59,470
Papa.

873
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,470
No.

874
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,620
No! Papa.

875
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:06,260
Papa, come on!

876
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:08,470
Over there! Take 'em down.

877
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:11,420
Come on. Papa. Come on.

878
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,790
Jyn, we gotta go. Come on.

879
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,300
I can't leave him.

880
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:18,620
Listen to me, he's gone.

881
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:20,540
Nothing you can do. Come on.

882
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:22,060
- I can't leave him.
- Come on!

883
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:23,380
I can't.

884
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:24,620
Move!

885
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,820
- This way, this way!
- Down!

886
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:39,180
Come on! Come on!

887
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:56,660
Well done.

888
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:59,020
You're a rebel now.

889
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:06,900
Let's go! Let's go!

890
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:08,460
Come on, let's move!

891
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:10,540
Come on, let's get out of here!

892
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:12,100
Move, move, move!

893
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,180
Okay, K-2. Let's go!

894
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:16,490
Copy that.

895
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:36,550
Ion thrusters low until
we've cleared the storm.

896
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:37,930
Understood.

897
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:57,580
You lied to me.

898
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:59,940
You're in shock.

899
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:02,740
You went up there to kill my father.

900
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:06,420
You don't know
what you're talking about.

901
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:07,940
Deny it.

902
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,900
You're in shock and looking
for some place to put it.

903
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:13,250
I've seen it before.

904
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:14,570
I bet you have.

905
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:15,710
They know.

906
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:19,150
You lied about why we came here
and you lied about why you went up alone.

907
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,980
I had every chance to pull the trigger...

908
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,780
but did I?

909
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:28,830
Did I?

910
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:30,410
You might as well have.

911
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,780
My father was living proof...

912
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:34,220
and you put him at risk.

913
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,740
Those were Alliance bombs
that killed him.

914
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:38,420
I had orders...

915
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,740
orders that I disobeyed.

916
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,420
But you wouldn't understand that.

917
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,650
Orders?

918
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:45,780
When you know they're wrong?

919
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:49,780
You might as well be a Stormtrooper.

920
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:51,260
What do you know?

921
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:53,660
We don't all have
the luxury of deciding...

922
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:56,140
when and where we want to
care about something.

923
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:58,900
Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you.

924
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,220
Some of us live it.

925
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:05,220
I've been in this fight
since I was 6 years old.

926
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:10,780
You're not the only one
who lost everything.

927
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:15,690
Some of us just decided
to do something about it.

928
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:20,660
You can't talk your way around this.

929
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:25,900
I don't have to.

930
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,260
Yavin 4.

931
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:35,180
Make sure they know
we're coming in with a stolen ship.

932
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:40,100
Anybody else?

933
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:40,580
My lord, Director Krennic...

934
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,740
has arrived.

935
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,370
Director Krennic.

936
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:47,620
Lord Vader.

937
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:50,860
You seem unsettled.

938
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:52,220
No...

939
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:53,500
just pressed for time.

940
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:55,970
There's a great many things to attend to.

941
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:57,540
My apologies.

942
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:01,020
You do have
a great many things to explain.

943
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:03,570
I delivered the weapon
the Emperor requested.

944
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,540
I deserve an audience...

945
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:09,660
to make certain that
he understands its remarkable...

946
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,110
potential.

947
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:16,460
Its power to create problems
has certainly been confirmed.

948
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:18,540
A city destroyed...

949
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:21,660
an Imperial facility openly attacked.

950
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:25,100
It was Governor Tarkin
that suggested the test.

951
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:29,940
You were not summoned here
to grovel, Director Krennic.

952
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:31,070
No...

953
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:33,140
There is no Death Star.

954
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:34,550
The Senate has been informed...

955
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:37,980
that Jedha was destroyed
in a mining disaster.

956
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:39,230
Yes, my lord.

957
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:42,820
I expect you not to rest until
you can assure the Emperor...

958
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:45,410
that Galen Erso has not compromised

959
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:47,820
this weapon in any way.

960
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,180
So I'm still in command?

961
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:59,260
You'll speak to the Emperor about...

962
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:17,740
Be careful not to choke
on your aspirations, Director.

963
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:31,020
We must scatter the fleet.

964
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:34,500
We have no recourse but to surrender.

965
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,260
Are we really talking
about disbanding something...

966
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:39,420
that we've worked so hard to create?

967
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:41,180
We can't just give in!

968
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,260
We joined an alliance,
not a suicide pact.

969
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:45,150
We've only now managed
to gather our forces.

970
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:46,900
Gather our forces?

971
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:49,260
General Draven's already
blown up an Imperial base.

972
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:50,740
A decision needed to be made!

973
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,460
If it's war you want...

974
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:54,020
you'll fight alone.

975
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:56,160
If that's how it's going,
why have an alliance at all?

976
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:59,220
If she's telling the truth,
we need to act now!

977
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:00,740
Councilors, please.

978
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:01,910
It is simple.

979
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:04,490
The Empire has the means
of mass destruction...

980
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:05,770
the Rebellion does not.

981
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:07,740
A Death Star. This is nonsense.

982
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,510
What reason
would my father have to lie?

983
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:11,300
What benefit would it bring him?

984
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,300
To lure our forces into a final battle

985
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:14,780
to destroy us once and for all.

986
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:17,740
Risk everything?
Based on what?

987
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:19,100
The testimony of a criminal?

988
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:22,420
The dying words of her father,
an Imperial scientist?

989
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:24,380
But don't forget
the Imperial pilot.

990
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:27,670
My father gave his life so that
we may have a chance to defeat this.

991
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,710
So you've told us.

992
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:31,100
If the Empire has this kind of power,

993
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:32,460
what chance do we have?

994
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:34,980
What chance do we have?

995
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:37,620
The question is "what choice."

996
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:39,460
Run, hide...

997
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:42,010
plead for mercy, scatter your forces.

998
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:44,980
You give way to an enemy this evil
with this much power...

999
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:48,060
and you condemn the galaxy
to an eternity of submission.

1000
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,020
- The time to fight is now!
- Yes.

1001
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:51,300
Every moment you waste

1002
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:53,500
is another step closer
to the ashes of Jedha.

1003
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,580
What is she proposing?

1004
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:57,960
Just let the girl speak.

1005
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:59,660
Send your best troops to Scarif.

1006
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:04,710
Send the rebel fleet if you have to.

1007
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,100
You need to capture
the Death Star plans

1008
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:08,750
if there's any hope of destroying it.

1009
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,820
You're asking us to invade
an Imperial installation...

1010
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:17,900
based on nothing but hope.

1011
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:22,380
Rebellions are built on hope.

1012
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:26,020
There is no hope.

1013
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:27,820
I say we fight.

1014
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:30,620
I say the Rebellion is finished!

1015
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:36,580
I'm sorry, Jyn.

1016
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:40,740
Without the full support of the Council...

1017
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:44,620
the odds are too great.

1018
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,900
General Syndulla,

1019
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,900
please report to the briefing room.

1020
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:10,620
You don't look happy.

1021
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:12,450
They prefer to surrender.

1022
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:13,670
And you?

1023
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:14,990
She wants to fight.

1024
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,220
So do I. We all do.

1025
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:19,460
The Force is strong.

1026
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:22,220
I'm not sure four of us is quite enough.

1027
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:23,740
How many do we need?

1028
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:25,220
What are you talking about?

1029
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:35,420
They were never gonna believe you.

1030
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:37,140
I appreciate the support.

1031
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:38,940
But I do.

1032
01:19:41,470 --> 01:19:42,940
I believe you.

1033
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,220
We'd like to volunteer.

1034
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:53,780
Some of us...

1035
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:55,700
Well, most of us...

1036
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:59,540
we've all done terrible things
on behalf of the Rebellion.

1037
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:01,780
Spies...

1038
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:05,340
saboteurs, assassins.

1039
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:09,940
Everything I did, I did for the Rebellion.

1040
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:12,780
And every time I walked away...

1041
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:15,330
from something I wanted to forget...

1042
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:20,140
I told myself it was
for a cause that I believed in.

1043
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,740
A cause that was worth it.

1044
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:26,460
Without that, we're lost.

1045
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:30,300
Everything we've done
would have been for nothing.

1046
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:36,170
I couldn't face myself if I gave up now.

1047
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:41,300
None of us could.

1048
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:47,740
It won't be comfortable.

1049
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,780
It'd be a bit cramped, but we'd all fit.

1050
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:54,540
We could go.

1051
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:58,340
Okay. Gear up.

1052
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:00,780
Grab anything that's not nailed down.

1053
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:03,790
Go, go, go!

1054
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:04,930
Jyn.

1055
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:07,940
I'll be there for you.

1056
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,820
Cassian said I had to.

1057
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:21,060
I'm not used to people sticking around
when things go bad.

1058
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,220
Welcome home.

1059
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:49,220
May the Force be with us.

1060
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:57,150
Cargo shuttle, read back please.

1061
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:58,310
What's going on out there?

1062
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:01,380
That ship's off-limits.

1063
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:04,340
No one's supposed to be on board
until further instructions.

1064
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:06,900
Yes, yes, we are.

1065
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:08,180
Affirmative.

1066
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,780
That's an impounded Imperial ship.

1067
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:12,140
What's your call sign, pilot?

1068
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:14,420
- Um...
- We have to go.

1069
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:15,940
It's, um...

1070
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:18,260
Say something.

1071
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,750
Come on.

1072
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:21,430
Rogue.

1073
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:25,140
Rogue One.

1074
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,540
Rogue One?

1075
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:29,140
There is no Rogue One!

1076
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,580
Well, there is now.

1077
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:33,380
Rogue One, pulling away.

1078
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,060
Pulling away.

1079
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:52,460
Despite what the others say,
war is inevitable.

1080
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:53,630
Yes, I agree.

1081
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:55,940
I must return to Alderaan
to inform my people

1082
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:57,940
that there will be no peace.

1083
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:00,780
We will need every advantage.

1084
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,300
Your friend...

1085
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:05,740
the Jedi.

1086
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:09,460
He served me well
during the Clone Wars...

1087
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:12,060
and has lived in hiding
since the Emperor's purge.

1088
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:13,620
Yes, I will send for him.

1089
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:16,060
You will need someone you can trust.

1090
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:20,020
I would trust her with my life.

1091
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:21,820
- Captain Antilles.
- Senator.

1092
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:23,980
I have a mission for you, sir.

1093
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:36,580
Okay. We're coming in.

1094
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:38,760
There's a planet-wide defensive shield...

1095
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:40,340
with a single main entry gate.

1096
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:42,110
This shuttle should be equipped with

1097
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:44,340
an access code that allows us through.

1098
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:46,820
Assuming the Empire hasn't
logged it as overdue.

1099
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,220
And if they have?

1100
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:51,650
Then they shut the gate.

1101
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:53,180
And we're all annihilated

1102
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:55,500
in the cold, dark vacuum of space.

1103
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:57,860
Not me.

1104
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:01,770
I can survive in space.

1105
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:13,540
Okay.

1106
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:14,850
Here goes.

1107
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:22,850
Cargo shuttle SW-0608
requesting a landing pad.

1108
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:27,980
Cargo shuttle SW-0608,

1109
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:29,940
you're not listed on the arrival schedule.

1110
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:32,140
Acknowledged, Gate Control.

1111
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:35,020
We were rerouted
from Eadu flight station.

1112
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:36,550
Transmitti ng clearance code now.

1113
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:37,980
Transmitting.

1114
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:53,220
Cargo shuttle, SW-0608...

1115
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,740
- you are cleared for entry.
- Yes!

1116
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:59,300
Impressive.

1117
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,260
I'll tell the others.

1118
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:09,090
Okay.

1119
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:15,900
Tractor
beam test in bays 2 through 8.

1120
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:19,260
Tractor beam test in bays 2 through 8.

1121
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:30,770
SW-0608,
cleared for Landing Pad 9.

1122
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,740
Acknowledge, please.

1123
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:36,570
SW-0608 proceeding
to LP 9 as instructed.

1124
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:39,040
Main building
down there, what is it?

1125
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:40,500
That's the Citadel Tower.

1126
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:43,420
They keep all the Imperial
structural archives up there.

1127
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:45,820
If the plans are anywhere,
they'll be there.

1128
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:48,740
And the dish
at the top, what's it for?

1129
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:52,180
I guess it takes a lot of signal
to send those data files out.

1130
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:56,820
Landing track, engaged.

1131
01:25:57,710 --> 01:25:58,770
Landing track locked.

1132
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:11,690
We're landing.

1133
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:16,420
We're coming in.

1134
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,350
Saw Gerrera used to say...

1135
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:27,140
one fighter with a sharp stick
and nothing left to lose can take the day.

1136
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:32,980
They've no idea we're coming.

1137
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:35,900
They've no reason to expect us.

1138
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:38,100
If we can make it to the ground,

1139
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:39,780
we'll take the next chance.

1140
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:43,700
And the next. On and on until we win...

1141
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:48,020
or the chances are spent.

1142
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:52,970
The Death Star plans are down there.

1143
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:57,380
Cassian, K-2, and I will find them.

1144
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:00,700
We'll find a way to find them.

1145
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:03,510
Melshi...

1146
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:05,300
Pao...

1147
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:06,540
Baze, Chirrut...

1148
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,180
you'll take the main squad.

1149
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:09,940
Move east and get wide of the ship.

1150
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:12,340
Find a position between
here and the tower.

1151
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,550
Once you get to the best spot...

1152
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:16,380
light the place up.

1153
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:19,820
Make 10 men feel like 100.

1154
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:24,060
And get those troopers away from us.

1155
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:26,140
What should I do?

1156
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,660
Keep the engine running.

1157
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:30,460
You're our only way outta here.

1158
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:03,700
Cargo shuttle SW-0608...

1159
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:06,250
be prepared to receive inspection team.

1160
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:07,470
Ready?

1161
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:22,790
Hello.

1162
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:23,830
Hey.

1163
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:26,180
Oh, you're probably
looking for a manifest?

1164
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:27,390
That would be helpful.

1165
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:30,580
It's just down here.

1166
01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:40,120
Director Krennic,

1167
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:42,020
we are entering the Scarif shield gate.

1168
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:44,860
General Ramda has been
informed of your arrival.

1169
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:10,370
Good luck...

1170
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:12,180
little sister.

1171
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:19,700
Go! Go now! You're clear!

1172
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:23,170
All right, let's go!
Come on. Move, move, move.

1173
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:30,330
925-H to transport control.

1174
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:33,980
925-H to transport control.

1175
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:53,790
I've got a bad feeling about...

1176
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:54,910
- K!
- Quiet!

1177
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:56,170
What?

1178
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:33,900
We need a map.

1179
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:36,630
Well, I'm sure there's one
just lying about.

1180
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:39,300
You know what you have to do.

1181
01:31:09,710 --> 01:31:10,710
One per pad.

1182
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:12,780
Pick your spot.
We wanna draw them out.

1183
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:15,500
I'll call the timing. Go!

1184
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,480
Hey, did you hear the rumors?

1185
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:21,400
Yeah, the T-15s
have been marked obsolete.

1186
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:23,350
Oh boy,
it's about time for that.

1187
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:25,070
Hey!

1188
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:48,300
What the...

1189
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,660
Director, what brings you to Scarif?

1190
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:57,020
Galen Erso.

1191
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:58,780
I want every dispatch,

1192
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:01,380
every transmission he has ever sent...

1193
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:02,860
called up for inspection.

1194
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:05,030
All of them?

1195
01:32:05,790 --> 01:32:07,010
Yes, all of them.

1196
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:09,410
Get started.

1197
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:42,590
K.

1198
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:44,860
Our optimal route to the data vault

1199
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:47,410
places only 89 Stormtroopers
in our path.

1200
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:49,820
We will make it
no more than 33% of the way

1201
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:51,060
before we are killed.

1202
01:32:57,630 --> 01:32:58,740
Melshi, talk to me.

1203
01:32:58,910 --> 01:33:00,980
Ready. Ready. Standing by.

1204
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:07,180
Light it up.

1205
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:16,340
Come on.

1206
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:32,250
Are we blind?

1207
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:33,940
Deploy the garrison!

1208
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:35,170
Move!

1209
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:54,790
Troopers!

1210
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,470
Troopers! Troopers on the left.

1211
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,060
Get in! Get in!

1212
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:25,360
Sir, it's Scarif base.

1213
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:26,940
They're reporting a Rebel incursion.

1214
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:28,620
I want to speak with Director Krennic.

1215
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,900
He's there, sir. On Scarif.

1216
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:34,620
The original plans for this station
are kept there, are they not?

1217
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:35,790
They are.

1218
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:38,340
Prepare for the jump to hyperspace

1219
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:40,380
and inform Lord Vader.

1220
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:48,980
Can we help you?

1221
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:50,300
That won't be necessary.

1222
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:07,340
Senator!

1223
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:10,340
Senator!

1224
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:11,690
Stop right there, Private.

1225
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:13,180
Let him speak.

1226
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:16,340
Intercepted Imperial
transmission, ma'am.

1227
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:18,100
Rebels on Scarif.

1228
01:35:18,870 --> 01:35:20,580
I need to speak with Admiral Raddus.

1229
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:22,620
He's returned to his ship.

1230
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:24,460
He's going to fight.

1231
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:36,710
No!

1232
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:43,910
Attention, all flight personnel,

1233
01:35:43,950 --> 01:35:45,710
please report to
your commanders immediately.

1234
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:48,420
All flight personnel,

1235
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:50,310
please report to
your commanders immediately.

1236
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:53,220
We have been redirected to Scarif.

1237
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:55,620
Pilots, you'll be briefed

1238
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,620
by your squadron leaders en route.

1239
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:00,220
May the Force be with you.

1240
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:03,500
Scarif? They're goi ng to Scarif?

1241
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:06,220
Why does nobody
ever tel I me anythi ng, R2?

1242
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:11,180
Move, move, move!

1243
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:17,540
Forward! Forward!

1244
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:19,820
Keep drawing them out!

1245
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:27,400
Pad 12, report to ground.

1246
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:28,760
Coming in on our flank.
We need numbers.

1247
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:30,240
Pad 14,
what's going on down there?

1248
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:32,980
Status please.
All pads report in immediately.

1249
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:34,520
Oh, no.
We have rebels everywhere!

1250
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:35,610
We're taking fire!

1251
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,940
Pad 12, Pad 14 request assistance.

1252
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:40,260
This is Pad 2. Pad 2.

1253
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:42,420
I spot 40 rebels heading west on Pad 2.

1254
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:44,920
Get on there. T ell him you're pinned
down by rebels on Pad 5.

1255
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:47,660
This is Pad 5!
We're being overrun! Help us!

1256
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:49,900
Pad 12, Pad 10, Pad 8, please confirm.

1257
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:51,340
Confirm and report.

1258
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:54,500
Get reinforcements down
to Pad 5 immediately!

1259
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:59,460
This is not working, K!

1260
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,530
Right hand.

1261
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:23,990
Baze!

1262
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:26,630
- Baze!
- What?

1263
01:37:26,670 --> 01:37:28,140
Run!

1264
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:35,300
Karabast! AT-AT!

1265
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:38,710
Move!

1266
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,300
This is Admiral Raddus
of the Rebel Alliance.

1267
01:37:59,030 --> 01:38:01,380
All squadron leaders, report in.

1268
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:04,020
Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by.

1269
01:38:04,190 --> 01:38:06,540
This is Gold Leader standing by.

1270
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,980
This is Red Leader standing by.

1271
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:11,380
Sir, those are rebel ships.

1272
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:13,540
Get Admiral Gorin, immediately!

1273
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:16,340
Director, the rebel fleet,

1274
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:18,060
it's amassing outside the shield.

1275
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:22,540
Lock down the base. Lock it down.

1276
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:24,380
- And close the shield?
- Do it!

1277
01:38:24,910 --> 01:38:27,420
Red and Gold Squadrons,
attack formations.

1278
01:38:27,630 --> 01:38:29,060
Defend the fleet.

1279
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:31,140
Blue Squadron, get to the surface

1280
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:32,540
before they close that gate.

1281
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:33,500
Copy you, Admiral.

1282
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:35,300
Blue Squadron, on me!

1283
01:38:35,470 --> 01:38:36,220
Copy, Blue Leader.

1284
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:38,220
- Copy, Blue Leader.
- We won't have long.

1285
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:52,900
Close the field aperture now! Close it!

1286
01:38:58,310 --> 01:38:59,350
Come on, come on, come on!

1287
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:00,990
Pull up!

1288
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:14,730
The rebel fleet has arrived.

1289
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:15,910
What?

1290
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:17,460
There's fighting on the beach.

1291
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:19,580
They've locked down the base.

1292
01:39:19,670 --> 01:39:20,910
They've closed the shield gate.

1293
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:22,340
What does that mean?

1294
01:39:24,950 --> 01:39:25,950
We're trapped?

1295
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:30,380
We could transmit the plans
to the rebel fleet.

1296
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:33,660
We'd have to get a signal up
to tell them it's coming.

1297
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:35,040
It's the size of the data files.

1298
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:36,180
That's the problem.

1299
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:37,860
They'll never get through.

1300
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:40,540
Someone has to
take that shield gate down.

1301
01:39:41,150 --> 01:39:43,100
Bodhi. Bodhi, can you hear me?

1302
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:44,980
Bodhi, tell me you're out there.

1303
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:47,020
Bodhi?

1304
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:48,500
I'm here.

1305
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:49,730
I was standing by.

1306
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:51,480
They've started fighting.
The base is on lockdown.

1307
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:54,420
I know. Listen to me.
The rebel fleet is up there.

1308
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:56,680
You've gotta tell them to
blow a hole in the shield gate...

1309
01:39:56,710 --> 01:39:58,820
so we can transmit the plans.

1310
01:39:58,990 --> 01:40:02,100
Wait. I can't. I'm not hooked
into the comms tower.

1311
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:03,300
We're not tied in.

1312
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:05,390
It's the only way
we're getting them out of here.

1313
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:06,590
Find a way!

1314
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:08,500
Cover our backs.

1315
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:11,750
You'll need this.

1316
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:15,110
You wanted one, right?

1317
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:22,380
Your behavior, Jyn Erso,
is continually unexpected.

1318
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:25,260
Jyn. Come on.

1319
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:46,010
Sa'kalla!

1320
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:47,940
Fire on my command.

1321
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:04,230
Look!

1322
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:16,950
Get ready. We're gonna have
to go out there.

1323
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:20,590
What are you doing?

1324
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:23,380
They've closed the shield gate.

1325
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:25,220
We're stuck here.

1326
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:26,790
But the rebel fleet are pulling in.

1327
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:29,040
We just have to get a signal
strong enough to get through to them...

1328
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:31,340
and let them know
that we're trapped down here.

1329
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:33,480
For that, we have to connect
to the communications tower.

1330
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:35,660
Now, I can patch us in over here,
the landing pad.

1331
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:37,150
But you have to get on the radio.

1332
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:40,260
Get one of the guys out there
to find a master switch.

1333
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:43,000
Get them to activate the connection
between us and that comms tower.

1334
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:43,700
Okay?

1335
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:45,180
Then go!

1336
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:50,580
What's going on
down there, Lieutenant?

1337
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:51,940
Unknown, sir.

1338
01:41:52,110 --> 01:41:53,170
We can't raise them.

1339
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:54,630
All rebel frequencies are blocked.

1340
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:57,830
Keep trying.
Engage those Star Destroyers

1341
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:59,780
and let's start probing that shield!

1342
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:01,100
Yes, sir!

1343
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:04,260
We're going in.

1344
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:11,210
Stay with me.

1345
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:49,980
Schematic bank, data tower two.

1346
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:51,180
How do I find that?

1347
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:52,820
Searching.

1348
01:42:53,630 --> 01:42:54,770
I can locate the tape,

1349
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:57,100
but you'll need to use
the handles for extraction.

1350
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:03,620
What am I supposed to do with this?

1351
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:06,300
Whoa!

1352
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:22,790
Well, finally.

1353
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:24,260
Wait! Stop!

1354
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:27,300
The rebels, they went over there.

1355
01:43:27,470 --> 01:43:29,700
K, what's going on out there?

1356
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:30,910
There's one.

1357
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:32,790
Ah, well.

1358
01:43:43,870 --> 01:43:44,870
Come on!

1359
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:54,140
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1360
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:56,540
We're starting our attack run
on the shield gate.

1361
01:43:56,710 --> 01:43:58,940
Keep it tight, and watch out
for those towers.

1362
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:15,900
More fighters. Form out at six-five.

1363
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:19,500
Sir, enemy fighters coming in.

1364
01:44:25,950 --> 01:44:28,940
Melshi! Melshi, come in.
Are you there?

1365
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:31,410
Bodhi sent a signal from here.
He's patching us in.

1366
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:33,550
But you guys have to open up
a line for the tower.

1367
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:35,260
How? Please advise.

1368
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:37,660
There's a master switch
at the base of the comm tower.

1369
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:40,290
Master switch? Describe.
What are we looking for?

1370
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:43,580
What does it look like?
The master switch? Where is it?

1371
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:46,340
U-wings, reinforce
those troops on the beach.

1372
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:48,020
All fighters, on me.

1373
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:49,790
We have to shield them from air attack.

1374
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:53,740
Troop reinforcements. Here we go.

1375
01:44:56,670 --> 01:44:59,340
For Jedha!

1376
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:07,300
We're having no effect on that shield.

1377
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:09,140
How much more can that thing take?

1378
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:14,140
Stick close, Red Five.
Where are you goin'?

1379
01:45:14,990 --> 01:45:17,150
They're all over me.
I'm trying to lose them!

1380
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:20,460
This is Red Five! I need help!

1381
01:45:26,910 --> 01:45:29,470
"Hyperspace tracking.
Navigational systems."

1382
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:32,230
Two screens down.

1383
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:34,300
"Structural engineering." Open that one.

1384
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:38,110
I've got one on my tail!

1385
01:45:38,710 --> 01:45:39,820
I'm on him!

1386
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:58,140
Project code names: "Stellarsphere,
Mark Omega, Pax Aurora."

1387
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:14,380
"War-Mantle, Cluster Prism,
Blacksaber."

1388
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:16,170
What?

1389
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:17,620
"Stardust."

1390
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:20,870
That's it.

1391
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:22,820
How do you know that?

1392
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:25,060
I know because it's me.

1393
01:46:28,230 --> 01:46:30,740
Hey, you! Identify yourself.

1394
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:35,700
I can...

1395
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:37,570
Incoming fire! Get cover!

1396
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:47,740
K, we need the file
for Stardust.

1397
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:52,790
Stardust.

1398
01:46:56,990 --> 01:46:57,990
That's it.

1399
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:20,590
K?

1400
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:21,950
Climb.

1401
01:47:22,110 --> 01:47:23,110
Climb.

1402
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:26,940
You can still send the plans to the fleet.

1403
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:29,180
If they open the shield gate...

1404
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:31,460
you can broadcast from the tower.

1405
01:47:32,670 --> 01:47:34,020
Locking the vault door now.

1406
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:35,150
K?

1407
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:36,270
K!

1408
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:37,820
- Goodbye.
- K!

1409
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:57,780
Sir, unauthorized access
at the data vault.

1410
01:47:58,950 --> 01:47:59,950
What?

1411
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:01,620
It's just come in, sir.

1412
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:07,220
Send my guard squadron into battle.

1413
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:09,060
Two men with me, now.

1414
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:12,300
Get that beach under control!

1415
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:16,090
Bodhi, are you there?
Did you call the fleet?

1416
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:18,020
I can't get to the shuttle.

1417
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:20,340
I can't plug in.

1418
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:23,140
You have to. They have to hit that gate.

1419
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:25,660
If the shield's open,
we can send the plans.

1420
01:48:56,150 --> 01:48:58,020
General, behind you!

1421
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:12,390
Step back.

1422
01:49:21,510 --> 01:49:23,020
We're going down!

1423
01:49:29,030 --> 01:49:30,030
Come on!

1424
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:32,940
Melshi, Melshi.

1425
01:50:33,110 --> 01:50:34,330
Come in, please.

1426
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:35,770
I'm tied in at my end.

1427
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:36,950
I just need an open line.

1428
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:38,660
Hang on.

1429
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:41,420
The master switch.

1430
01:50:42,230 --> 01:50:43,940
It's over near that console.

1431
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:48,710
I'm going!

1432
01:50:58,310 --> 01:50:59,420
I've got it!

1433
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:02,750
Careful!

1434
01:51:03,630 --> 01:51:04,630
You okay?

1435
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:14,990
Jyn!

1436
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:35,260
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

1437
01:51:36,150 --> 01:51:37,520
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

1438
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:38,550
Chirrut!

1439
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:51,300
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1440
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:53,230
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

1441
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:54,310
I'm one with the Force...

1442
01:51:54,510 --> 01:51:56,460
the Force is with me.
I'm one with the Force...

1443
01:51:56,630 --> 01:51:57,630
and the Force is with me.

1444
01:51:57,710 --> 01:52:02,380
I'm one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

1445
01:52:03,110 --> 01:52:04,860
Chirrut! Come back!

1446
01:52:05,070 --> 01:52:06,070
I'm one with the Force...

1447
01:52:14,550 --> 01:52:15,550
Yes!

1448
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:21,330
Keep going! Keep going!

1449
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:27,740
Cassian!

1450
01:52:37,070 --> 01:52:39,260
Chirrut! Come! Come with me!

1451
01:52:44,230 --> 01:52:45,540
Chirrut!

1452
01:52:51,190 --> 01:52:52,190
Chirrut.

1453
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:54,740
Don't go. Don't go.

1454
01:52:54,910 --> 01:52:56,420
I'm here, I'm here.

1455
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:58,620
It's okay.

1456
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:02,980
It's okay. Look for the Force.

1457
01:53:03,190 --> 01:53:04,460
Chirrut.

1458
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:07,340
And you will always find me.

1459
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:12,090
The Force is with me
and I'm one with the Force.

1460
01:53:13,470 --> 01:53:17,340
The Force is with me
and I'm one with the Force.

1461
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:22,660
The Force is with me
and I'm one with the Force.

1462
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:39,140
Deflector shields down to 50%!
We're sustaining heavy damage!

1463
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:41,260
There's no turning back now!

1464
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:42,900
We have to press the attack!

1465
01:53:49,310 --> 01:53:50,440
Hit that opening!

1466
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:51,720
We see it, Gold Leader.

1467
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:53,300
Ion torpedoes away!

1468
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:04,280
What's happening?

1469
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:05,980
We've lost engine power, sir.

1470
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:11,140
That Star Destroyer's disabled.

1471
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:15,700
This is Rogue One calling
any Alliance ships that can hear me.

1472
01:54:17,830 --> 01:54:19,160
Is there anybody out there?
This is Rogue One.

1473
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:20,190
Come in, over!

1474
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:22,500
This is Admiral Raddus,
Rogue One. We hear you.

1475
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:26,820
We have the plans.

1476
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:28,840
They found the Death Star plans.

1477
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:30,960
They have to transmit them
from the communications tower.

1478
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:32,240
You have to take down the shield gate.

1479
01:54:32,270 --> 01:54:34,300
It's the only way
they're gonna get them through.

1480
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:38,540
Call up a Hammerhead corvette.
I have an idea.

1481
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:40,180
Stand by, Rogue One. We're on it.

1482
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:42,020
This is for you, Galen.

1483
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:14,380
The Force is with me,
and I'm one with the Force.

1484
01:56:05,470 --> 01:56:07,140
Corvette Five, locked on target!

1485
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:09,890
Prepare for impact.

1486
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:23,660
Sublight thrusters, full power!

1487
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:02,740
Reset antenna alignment.

1488
01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:05,820
Reset antenna alignment.

1489
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:08,820
Reset antenna alignment.

1490
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:12,180
Reset antenna alignment.

1491
01:57:36,150 --> 01:57:38,060
Reverse engines! Full power!

1492
01:57:59,470 --> 01:58:00,790
Antenna aligned.

1493
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:02,100
Ready to transmit.

1494
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:37,950
Who are you?

1495
01:58:40,270 --> 01:58:41,540
You know who I am.

1496
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:45,780
I'm Jyn Erso.

1497
01:58:46,430 --> 01:58:48,300
Daughter of Galen and Lyra.

1498
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:49,950
You've lost.

1499
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:52,020
Oh, I have, have I?

1500
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:53,860
My father's revenge.

1501
01:58:54,230 --> 01:58:55,590
He built a flaw in the Death Star.

1502
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:57,620
He put a fuse in the middle
of your machine...

1503
01:58:57,790 --> 01:58:59,870
and I've just told the entire galaxy
how to light it.

1504
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:03,220
The shield is up.

1505
01:59:03,390 --> 01:59:05,740
Your signal will never reach
the rebel base.

1506
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:07,940
All your ships in the air
will be destroyed.

1507
01:59:08,150 --> 01:59:09,940
I lose nothing but time.

1508
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:12,180
You, on the other hand...

1509
01:59:13,110 --> 01:59:15,380
die with the Rebellion.

1510
01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:47,390
Transmitting.

1511
01:59:49,630 --> 01:59:50,660
Transmitting.

1512
01:59:52,670 --> 01:59:55,700
Admiral, receiving
transmission from Scarif.

1513
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:07,180
Leave it, leave it!

1514
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:08,490
That's it.

1515
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:10,890
That's it.

1516
02:00:12,350 --> 02:00:13,350
Let's go.

1517
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:15,380
Transmission received.

1518
02:00:15,590 --> 02:00:17,860
Admiral, we have the plans!

1519
02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:19,500
She did it!

1520
02:00:21,230 --> 02:00:24,140
Do you think anybody's listening?

1521
02:00:25,110 --> 02:00:26,300
I do.

1522
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:29,780
Someone's out there.

1523
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:34,060
Sir, we're detecting a massive object

1524
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:36,340
emerging from hyperspace.

1525
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:43,980
Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet?

1526
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:45,470
Lord Vader will handle the fleet.

1527
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:49,700
Target the base at Scarif,
single reactor ignition.

1528
02:00:49,870 --> 02:00:51,060
Yes, sir.

1529
02:00:56,270 --> 02:00:57,270
Come on.

1530
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:23,260
You may fire when ready.

1531
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:29,950
Commence primary ignition.

1532
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:55,300
Rogue One, may the Force be with you.

1533
02:01:59,230 --> 02:02:02,460
All ships prepare
for jump to hyperspace.

1534
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:37,140
Your father would have been
proud of you, Jyn.

1535
02:02:51,470 --> 02:02:53,840
The rebel
flagship is disabled, my lord...

1536
02:02:53,870 --> 02:02:56,060
but has received transmissions
from the surface.

1537
02:02:56,510 --> 02:02:58,780
Prepare a boarding party.

1538
02:02:59,030 --> 02:03:00,500
Yes, my lord.

1539
02:03:36,390 --> 02:03:37,390
Hurry!

1540
02:03:41,070 --> 02:03:43,100
Let's go! We gotta go, now!

1541
02:03:44,910 --> 02:03:46,580
Move! Move! Move!

1542
02:03:47,630 --> 02:03:48,900
Hurry. Let's go!

1543
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:50,070
Let's go!

1544
02:03:50,190 --> 02:03:51,190
It's stuck!

1545
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:53,590
Hey!

1546
02:03:53,950 --> 02:03:55,260
Hey! Help!

1547
02:04:12,150 --> 02:04:13,260
Open fire!

1548
02:04:19,270 --> 02:04:20,270
Help us!

1549
02:04:24,110 --> 02:04:25,110
It's jammed!

1550
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:27,150
Pull it!

1551
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:33,670
Pull it!

1552
02:04:37,550 --> 02:04:38,820
Here! Here!

1553
02:04:39,310 --> 02:04:40,580
Take it! Take it!

1554
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:49,470
Launch!

1555
02:05:17,110 --> 02:05:18,780
Make sure you secure the airlock.

1556
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:20,660
And prepare the escape pods.

1557
02:05:24,990 --> 02:05:25,990
Your highness.

1558
02:05:26,750 --> 02:05:28,620
The transmission we received.

1559
02:05:29,670 --> 02:05:31,340
What is it they've sent us?

1560
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:34,460
Hope.
